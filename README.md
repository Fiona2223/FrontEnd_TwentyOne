# Game 21 Front-End Project
Our project involved creating a React front-end application that provides a user-friendly interface for one of the server-side APIs developed by another backend group during week 6 of the bootcamp. 

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

https://github.com/thibyaa/Backend_TwentyOne_API


* Software needed to run the API: 
	* IntelliJ and Java (version 17)
	* Postman
	* Postico
	* PostgreSQL

* Installation instructions:
	* Git clone from the server side API Repo
	* Create an SQL database  and name it `Backend_TwentyOne_API` so that it matches with the name in the `application.properties` file (src of server side API)
	* Once your database has been created, run the `BackendTwentyOneApiApplication.java` file in IntelliJ to get started.
	* You can set up your tests using Postman on `localhost:8080/{extension}` or type in `localhost:8080/games` in your browser, for example, to see the games data. More details can be found from the backend repo
